Objective
In this challenge, we're going to learn about the difference between a class and an instance; because this is an Object Oriented concept, it's only enabled in certain languages. 

Task
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age , and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. 
The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; 
if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1 .
2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
      a. If age<13, print You are young..
      b. If  age>=13 and age<18, print You are a teenager..
      c. Otherwise, print You are old..
